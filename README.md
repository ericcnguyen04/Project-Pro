# Project-Pro
Project Pro will be a productivity app designed to keep track of all 'galaxy' in your life, whether it is work, school, hobbies, etc. With all of these 'galaxies' to keep track of, it truly is challenging. Combining all galaxies will form into a universe, Project Pro. This project is an inspiration of a rising software, Notion. This trending software attacked my ego and skillset, and I strive to replicate it.

## Approach
In developing Project Pro, the approach will focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Drawing inspiration from successful productivity tools like Notion, the goal is to provide a seamless experience for users to manage and navigate through their different 'galaxies' effortlessly.

## Technologies Used
Project Pro will be built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, a powerful and popular choice for developing full-stack applications. This technology stack enables a smooth integration of the front-end and back-end, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience.
