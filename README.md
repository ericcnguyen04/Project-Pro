# Project-Pro
Project Pro will be a productivity app designed to keep track of all 'galaxy' in your life, whether it is work, school, hobbies, etc. With all of these 'galaxies' to keep track of, it truly is challenging. Combining all galaxies will form into a universe, Project Pro. This project is an inspiration of a rising software, Notion. This trending software attacked my ego and skillset, and I strive to replicate it.
